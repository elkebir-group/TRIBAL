TRIBAL trees jointly model the evolutionary processes of somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. The input to TRIBAL is a multiple sequence alignment for each of the predetermined clonotypes aligned to the germline sequence and the isotype of each sequenced B cell. The output is a B cell lineage tree with nodes labeled by BCR sequences (concatenated heavy and light chain) and the isotype of each B cell.
